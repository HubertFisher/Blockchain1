# Sorting Library
A Rust library providing implementations of quick sort, select sort, insert sort, and merge sort sorting algorithms.
## Usage
To use library you can simply import it 

## Sorting Algorithms
### Quick Sort
It is a sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element from the array, partitions the array into two sub-arrays based on the pivot, and recursively sorts each sub-array. It's known for its efficiency and is widely used in practice.<br>

### Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges them to produce a sorted output.<br>

### Insertion Sort
iterates through the list, inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.<br>

### Selection Sort
iterates through the list, selects the minimum element, and swaps it with the first unsorted element. Repeat until the list is sorted.<br>
